# about
* In this project, I made a quiz game, which uses html, CSS, and JavaScript to complete. The html is to create the content of the quiz, such as the title, and all the words in the quiz. The CSS is for the format of the quiz, to make it look better, and JavaScript is for the timer, keeping track of the score, making sure that each button works, and many other functions. 

* This quiz game will have 5 questions, with 4 multiple choices each. The user will first press the start button located in the bottom of the page, and the page will lead the user to the first question. As the user presses the start button, the timer also starts counting down. If the user couldn't complete the quiz in the amount of time required, the user will fail the quiz, everytime the user selects a wrong answer, the timer will decrease by an amount of time. If the user selects a right answer, they will gain 1 point. When the game is over, the user can save their initial and score.
